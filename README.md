# **GNN Project: TCR Sequence Classification**

##  Overview  
This project explores **graph-based representations** and **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for classifying patients (From different Datasets) using **TCR sequence embeddings**. The approach leverages **graph structure**, **adjacency relationships**, and **centrality measures** to extract meaningful features for classification.  

This project integrates **graph structure** and **node-level features** to improve **TCR sequence analysis and patient classification**.
