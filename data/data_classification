total 139 patients, sub sampled to 21272 TCR seq.
83 original patiens - 49 healthy (ichilov), 34 sick(shiba).
47 nd (new data - 21 sick ichilov, 26 healthy shiba)
9 nh (healthy, TBD from which hospital)
Currently no fp patients (12 from shiba)


in embedding_graphs_90th_perc folder, files are saved in pickle format, as netwrokx files, with their embedding (as 'embbedding').
has all 139 patients mentiond above, plus 6 of the 12 fp patients (excluding 35, 42,43,44,46,8)
general_scripts.py is used to create netx graphs based on a certion threshold (percentile), based on csv with embedding for each TCR seq of each patient.
random_scripts.py is used to create torch data object from netx graphs.
